# Cape-Cod-Database
This program is designed to allow the management of several recreational activities occurring in Barnstable on Cape Cod, MA. When the program is first opened, the user of the system is prompted to make a selection from a menu screen. The sections available are parking permits, fishing licenses, boat registrations, boat info, boat licenses, users, and to view all the records managed by the system. Once the user has made a selection, they are brought to a specific module to direct that section. To manage the section selected, the user may either review records or add a new one.
